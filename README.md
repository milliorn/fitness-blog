# Next.js Blog

This is a Next.js project for a personal blog. It was bootstrapped with create-next-app.

## Getting Started

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the blog.

You can edit the pages by modifying the files in the pages directory. The changes will be automatically updated in the browser.

API routes can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/api/hello. You can edit this endpoint in the pages/api/hello.ts file. Files in the pages/api directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
